Title: A* (A-star) Search Algorithm in Data Structures

Definition:
A* is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses both the actual cost to reach a node and an estimated cost (heuristic) to the goal.

Problem Statement:
Suppose you want to find the shortest route from your home to a destination on a map. A* helps you find the best path efficiently using a heuristic (like straight-line distance).

Working:
- A* keeps track of the cost to reach each node and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal.
- It always explores the node with the lowest total estimated cost.

Steps:
1. Add the start node to an open set.
2. While the open set is not empty:
   a. Pick the node with the lowest estimated total cost.
   b. If it's the goal, stop.
   c. Otherwise, update costs for its neighbors and add them to the open set.

Example:
Letâ€™s find the shortest path in a simple grid using A*.

"""
Explanation:
- A* uses both the cost so far and an estimate to the goal.
- It finds the shortest path efficiently using a heuristic.
- A* is used in maps, games, and robotics.
