Title: Bellman-Ford Algorithm in Data Structures

Definition:
The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, even if some edges have negative weights.

Problem Statement:
Suppose you want to find the shortest route in a city map where some roads have negative tolls (rewards). Bellman-Ford helps you find the shortest paths, even with negative weights.

Working:
- Start from the source node and set its distance to 0, all others to infinity.
- For each edge, update the distance if a shorter path is found.
- Repeat for all edges (V-1) times, where V is the number of vertices.
- Check for negative weight cycles.

Steps:
1. Set the distance to the source as 0, others as infinity.
2. For each edge, update the distance if a shorter path is found.
3. Repeat for all edges (V-1) times.
4. Check for negative weight cycles.

Example:
Letâ€™s find the shortest paths from node 0 in a simple graph.

    for _ in range(V - 1):
        for u, v, w in graph:
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w
    # Check for negative-weight cycles
    for u, v, w in graph:
        if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
            return
    print("Vertex \t Distance from Source")

"""
Explanation:
- The algorithm finds the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes, even with negative weights.
- It checks for negative weight cycles.
- Bellman-Ford is used in routing and network protocols.
