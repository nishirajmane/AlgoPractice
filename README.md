# Algorithms Educational Project

This project contains Python files for all major Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), each explained in a way that a 10th-grade student can understand.

## How to Set Up and Run

### 1. Install All Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Check Your Environment
Run the following script to check if all required packages are installed and can be imported:

```bash
python import_all_packages.py
```
- This will print `[OK]` for each successful import and `[ERROR]` for any missing or problematic package.

### 3. Run Individual Algorithm Files
- All DSA files are in the `DSA/` folder (e.g., `DSA/01_arrays.py`, `DSA/17_avl_tree.py`, etc.).
- All MLA files are in the `MLA/` folder (e.g., `MLA/01_linear_regression.py`, `MLA/21_recommendation_system.py`, etc.).

To run any file, use:
```bash
python DSA/01_arrays.py
python MLA/01_linear_regression.py
```

### 4. Learning Path
- Start with the lower-numbered files for basics, and move to higher numbers for advanced topics.
- Each file contains:
  - Problem statement
  - Definitions
  - Step-by-step explanation
  - Simple code example
  - Output and explanation

### 5. Additional Info
- If you see any `[ERROR]` in `import_all_packages.py`, install the missing package using `pip install package_name`.
- All code is written for clarity and learning, not for maximum performance.
- You can edit or experiment with any file to deepen your understanding.
